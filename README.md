ScreenKeyboard brings a mobile-grade keyboard to every Uno Platform target — WebAssembly, Windows, macOS, Linux
(X11 and framebuffer), Android and iOS. It is ideal for kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, industrial panels,
touch-screen desktops, in-car and TV apps, and any application that needs full control over text input.

The typing engine is platform independent (`ScreenKeyboard.Core`, pure .NET, fully unit tested), and the UI
(`ScreenKeyboard.Uno`) is a lightweight, code-built WinUI control that never steals focus from your text fields.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
|---|---|
| [`ScreenKeyboard.Uno`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScreenKeyboard.Uno) | The Uno Platform controls (`OnScreenKeyboard`, `ScreenKeyboardHost`), themes and input adapters. |
| [`ScreenKeyboard.Core`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScreenKeyboard.Core) | UI-independent engine: layouts, key computation, gestures, glide typing, NLP, emoji, clipboard, settings. Usable from any .NET UI framework. |

Targets: `net10.0` (Skia desktop & reference), `net10.0-desktop`, `net10.0-browserwasm`, `net10.0-android`,
`net10.0-ios` and `net10.0-windows10.0.26100` (WinAppSDK). Built with Uno.Sdk 6.7.

## Quick start

```bash
dotnet add package ScreenKeyboard.Uno
```

Wrap your page content in a `ScreenKeyboardHost`. The keyboard slides in whenever a `TextBox` or `PasswordBox`
gets focus and keeps the focused field visible:

```xml
<Page xmlns:sk="using:ScreenKeyboard.Controls">
  <sk:ScreenKeyboardHost>
    <StackPanel Spacing="12" Padding="24">
      <TextBox Header="Name" InputScope="PersonalFullName" />
      <TextBox Header="Email" InputScope="EmailSmtpAddress" sk:ScreenKeyboardInput.EnterAction="Next" />
      <TextBox Header="Amount" InputScope="Number" />
      <PasswordBox Header="PIN" />
    </StackPanel>
  </sk:ScreenKeyboardHost>
</Page>
```

Or place the keyboard yourself — it attaches to the focused input of its window automatically:

```xml
<Grid RowDefinitions="*,Auto">
  <TextBox AcceptsReturn="True" />
  <sk:OnScreenKeyboard Grid.Row="1" />
</Grid>
```

Configure everything in code:

```csharp
var keyboard = host.Keyboard;
keyboard.Settings.Subtypes = ["en-US/qwerty", "de-DE/qwertz", "fr-FR/azerty"];
keyboard.Settings.ThemeMode = ThemeMode.Dark;
keyboard.Settings.DarkTheme = "floris_pure_night";
keyboard.Settings.NumberRow = true;
keyboard.Settings.OneHandedMode = OneHandedMode.Right;
keyboard.EnterActionRequested += (s, e) => { if (e.Action == EnterAction.Search) { Search(); e.Handled = true; } };
```

On WebAssembly (and other Skia targets without a color emoji font) enable emoji rendering once at startup:

```csharp
if (OperatingSystem.IsBrowser())
    EmojiFontFallback.UseNotoColorEmoji();
```

## Sample app

[`samples/ScreenKeyboard.Sample`](samples/ScreenKeyboard.Sample) demonstrates every feature with a live settings
pane (themes, languages, gestures, typing options) and persistence of settings, learned words and emoji history.

```bash
dotnet run --project samples/ScreenKeyboard.Sample -f net10.0-desktop
dotnet run --project samples/ScreenKeyboard.Sample -f net10.0-browserwasm
```

Start-up options such as `?theme=dark&onehanded=right&langs=en-US/qwerty,de-DE/qwertz` (WebAssembly) or
`--theme=dark` (desktop) make it easy to try configurations.

## Using the engine without Uno

`ScreenKeyboard.Core` has no UI dependencies. Drive it from tests, another UI framework or a server:

```csharp
var engine = new KeyboardEngine();
var field = new TextBufferTarget();
engine.Attach(field);
engine.TypeText("i like teh ");
Console.WriteLine(field.Text); // "I like the "
```
